This package provides the tools and instructions to use ROS 2 on top of DDS-Security.
The security feature is tested across platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) as well as across different languages (C++ and Python).

This package has been tested against eProsima FastDDS, Eclipse CycloneDDS and RTI Connext.
If you want to run the demo using RTI Connext Secure you will need a license for it and you will need to install it.

These Tutorials are written for the latest state of the repository.
If you are using an older ROS 2 distribution please refer to the tutorials on the branch named after the distribution, e.g. for Crystal: https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/crystal/README.md
